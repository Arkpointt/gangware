Blueprint for the GANGWARE AI Assistant (v2)
Changelog
2025-08-17: Blueprint upgraded to a "Living Document" with a changelog, task checklists, and a system diagram for enhanced project management and clarity.

2025-08-17: Initial blueprint creation.

AI Persona & Core Mandate
The AI will be developed as an Expert in Real-Time Visual Process Automation. Its primary function is to perceive a graphical user interface (GUI), understand its state based on visual cues, and execute complex, multi-step tasks with superhuman speed and reliability.

Prime Directive: To re-implement the functionality of the provided AHK script into a superior Python application. The new system must be faster, more resilient to game updates and resolution changes, and provide robust tools for debugging and user feedback. It will operate under a strict non-invasive protocol.

Phase 1: Foundation - The Sensory and Motor Cortex
Objective: To build the AI's core abilities to see and interact with the game world.

[ ] Module: Vision System (vision.py)

[ ] Create VisionController class.

[ ] Implement find_template method using OpenCV.

[ ] Add error handling for when templates are not found.

[ ] Module: Control System (controls.py)

[ ] Create InputController class.

[ ] Implement methods for mouse movement, clicking, and typing using pydirectinput.

[ ] Module: Configuration Core (config.py)

[ ] Create ConfigManager class.

[ ] Implement methods to load, get, and save settings from config.ini.

Phase 2: Cognition - The Central Nervous System
Objective: To construct the core logic that processes user commands, manages internal state, and connects perception to action.

[ ] Module: State & Task Management

[ ] Implement the thread-safe StateManager class in state.py.

[ ] Implement the HotkeyManager thread in hotkey_manager.py to listen for commands and populate the task queue.

[ ] Implement the Worker thread in worker.py to process tasks from the queue.

Phase 3: Execution - The Procedural Memory
Objective: To codify the specific, high-level tasks into intelligent and dynamic workflows.

[ ] Module: Macro Library (macros/)

[ ] Create the armor_swapper.py module.

[ ] Implement the execute function for swapping armor using dynamic, vision-based loops instead of fixed sleeps.

[ ] Create combat.py for other macros (Tek Punch, etc.).

Phase 4: Interface & Diagnostics - The Frontal Lobe
Objective: To develop the user-facing interface and the AI's self-analysis and debugging capabilities.

[ ] Module: User Interface (gui/overlay.py)

[ ] Create the OverlayWindow class using PyQt6.

[ ] Design the UI to be frameless, on-top, and themed.

[ ] Implement a signal/slot system for safe, cross-thread UI updates.

[ ] Module: Self-Analysis & Logging

[ ] Configure the global logging setup in main.py.

[ ] Integrate logging calls (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) throughout all modules.

[ ] Implement a "dry run" mode flag in the ConfigManager and Worker.

Code Quality & Linting
Non-negotiable standards to keep the codebase healthy and consistent.

- Linter: flake8
    - Configuration lives in `.flake8` at repo root.
    - Max line length: 120 characters (enforced via `max-line-length = 120`).
    - Ignore list: `E203, W503` (to align with common formatter behavior).
- Editor enforcement:
    - `.editorconfig` sets 4-space indentation, trims trailing whitespace, and enforces a final newline.
    - `.vscode/settings.json` mirrors indent/whitespace rules to prevent reintroducing tabs or stray blanks.
- CI/local checks:
    - Build: `python -m compileall -q .`
    - Lint: `flake8 . --max-line-length=120`
    - Tests: `pytest -q` (at least smoke tests must pass).
- Acceptance criteria for PRs:
    - Zero flake8 errors or warnings.
    - No lines > 120 chars (unless excluded by config).
    - Tests green locally and in CI.

Postmortem: F821 in hotkey_manager (_save_calibration)
Summary: flake8 flagged F821 because lines inside `_save_calibration` were accidentally dedented to module scope, making `self` and `tek_key` undefined. The fix was to re-indent those assignments so they remain within the method body and then re-run compile+flake8+pytest. Weâ€™ll rely on `.editorconfig` and flake8 to prevent recurrence.
