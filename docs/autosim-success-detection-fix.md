## AutoSim Success Detection Fix

### Problem Identified
The AutoSim workflow was not detecting successful server joins properly.

### Root Cause
The original success detection logic had a fatal flaw:

```python
# Old logic (BROKEN)
if current_time - last_menu_detected >= 7.0 and last_menu_detected > 0:
    # Success!
```

This required `last_menu_detected > 0`, meaning:
1. A menu had to be detected first after clicking "Join Game"
2. Then 2 seconds had to pass without detecting any menus

**The Problem**: If the join happened quickly and no menu was ever detected after clicking "Join Game", `last_menu_detected` would remain 0, and the success condition would never trigger.

### Solution Implemented
Changed to track consecutive time without menu detection:

```python
# New logic (FIXED)
if self._detect_any_menu():
    consecutive_no_menu_time = 0.0  # Reset timer when menu found
else:
    if consecutive_no_menu_time == 0.0:
        consecutive_no_menu_time = current_time  # Start tracking

    if current_time - consecutive_no_menu_time >= 2.0:
        # SUCCESS - 2 seconds of no menus detected!
```

### Benefits
1. **Works for fast joins**: Detects success even if no menu is ever seen after clicking "Join Game"
2. **Works for slow joins**: Still detects success if menus disappear gradually
3. **Better logging**: Added debug messages to track progress toward 2-second threshold

### Testing
The fix ensures that when you successfully join a server:
- AutoSim will detect the absence of menus for 2 consecutive seconds
- Log "SUCCESS - No menu detected for 2 seconds, join successful!"
- Stop the automation and display "Successfully joined server!" status
